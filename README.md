# Zuhlke Spring Framework Demos - Project 2

## Description:

This Java project builds upon the Spring concepts used in project1
and introduces new concepts. It contains more examples on various types
of dependency injection, creating Spring components, scanning for Spring
components, creating primary and qualified components and other topics.

It has been built while following the Udemy Masterclass on Spring Framework
and Spring Boot 3 (this project is not a git clone of the Masterclass sources).
